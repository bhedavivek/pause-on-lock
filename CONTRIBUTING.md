# How to contribute

Hi there and thank you for your interest in contributing to pause-on-lock! You rock!

## Ways of contributing

There are three major ways of contributing:

  1. Reporting bugs
  2. Introducing new ideas
  3. Enhancing the code
  
### Reporting Bugs
  
If you found a bug in pause-on-lock, please [open an issue](https://github.com/folixg/pause-on-lock/issues/new/choose)
so that we can investigate and remove it.
  
### Introducing new ideas

If you have an idea how pause-on-lock can be improved (this can range from supporting an additional desktop environment
to whatever your mind comes up with) please also [open an issue](https://github.com/folixg/pause-on-lock/issues/new/choose)
and tell us about your idea.
  
### Enhancing the code

If you want to add a new feature or revise the existing code, feel free to submit a pull request. However, to make
sure that you don't waste your time please also consider [opening an issue](https://github.com/folixg/pause-on-lock/issues/new/choose)
for discussion beforehand.

## Coding Guidelines

The two basic rules for the coding style are:

  - Use 2 spaces for indentation
  - Limit line length to 80 characters (may be exceeded for e.g. long strings)

Other than that, try to make [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) happy.

## Repository layout

Starting after 06419d159170e5bd548c8fe23e8e318328944aa3 the repository uses the
branching model as described
[here](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).  That means
the [master](https://github.com/folixg/pause-on-lock/tree/master) branch will
only contain tagged commits and all feature branches should be based on the
[develop](https://github.com/folixg/pause-on-lock/tree/develop) branch.

Thanks again for contributing!
